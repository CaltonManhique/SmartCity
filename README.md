TrafficManagement.java: Simulates smart traffic management, including traffic lights, congestion detection, and rerouting of vehicles. You can use a CSV file (traffic_data.csv) to represent traffic data.

SmartLighting.java: Simulates smart lighting in the city, where street lights adjust their brightness based on the time of day and sensor data.

EnvironmentalMonitoring.java: Simulates environmental monitoring, including air quality, noise levels, and temperature.

traffic_data.csv: A sample data file for simulating traffic data. You can expand this to include more complex traffic data.

opencsv-5.5.2.jar: The OpenCSV library for reading and writing CSV files. You'll need to add this library to your project to handle the traffic data CSV file.

Vehicle.java: Represents a vehicle in the simulation In your smart city simulation project, you can use the Vehicle class to represent and manage vehicles within the simulation. Here are some scenarios where you can use the Vehicle class:
Traffic Management: Within the TrafficManagement class, you can create instances of the Vehicle class to simulate vehicles moving in the city. You can update the vehicles' positions, manage traffic lights, and simulate traffic congestion. For example, you can create instances of different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, buses, bicycles) and update their positions based on traffic flow and congestion.

Vehicle Tracking: You can use the Vehicle class to track and monitor the movement and behavior of vehicles. For instance, you can record the current speed, registration numbers, and types of vehicles. This information can be used to analyze traffic patterns and congestion.

Environmental Monitoring: If your simulation includes factors like vehicle emissions or noise pollution, you can use the Vehicle class to model these aspects. Each vehicle can contribute to environmental data, and you can update the environmental monitoring sensors based on the presence and behavior of vehicles.

Sensor.java: Represents a sensor used for environmental monitoring It has a sensorType field to specify the type of sensor (e.g., "Air Quality," "Noise Level," or "Temperature").
It has a currentValue field to store the current measured value of the sensor.

The measure method simulates measuring data by generating random values depending on the sensor type. You can replace the random value generation with actual sensor data reading in a real application.

The getCurrentValue method allows you to retrieve the current value measured by the sensor.

The getSensorType method returns the sensor type.

The toString method provides a string representation of the sensor for easy debugging and printing.
